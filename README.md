# Image Gallery

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to all screen sizes.
- **Image Search:** Fetches images using Unsplash API based on user input.

- **Seamless UX:** Automatically hides the load button when no more images are available.

## Technologies Used

## API Key

const accessKey = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE";
```
